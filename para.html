            In a Hindustan Times interview, KK was asked if he was bothered by being nominated for a number of awards but seldom winning. 
            He said no: "As a singer, I haven't felt any lesser by not getting an award.
             Winning or not winning an award doesn't affect me. I just like to do my work in the best possible manner.
             I am happy getting good songs. I am happy not getting awards.
